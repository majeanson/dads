# dads — working notes

Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) first. It holds the locked decisions and the milestone
list; do not relitigate a decision recorded there without asking.

## Rules

- **This repo only.** `~/Documents/WebApp` is a separate parent repo. Never
  commit or push anything outside `dads/`.
- **DO for live, D1 for durable.** Presence, chat fan-out, typing and relayed
  table events live in `RoomDO`. Anything that must survive an eviction —
  check-ins, commitments, prompts, message archive — goes to D1. If you find
  yourself persisting long-lived records in DO storage, that is the wrong side.
- **Multi-group from day one.** Every query is keyed by `group_id`. v1 shows one
  group; adding a second must never require a migration.
- **Tests run against the real schema.** `vitest.config.ts` reads
  `migrations/` and applies it to the faked D1. A migration that does not apply
  fails the suite.
- **Behavioural e2e only.** Playwright asserts what a dad can do, not what a
  pixel looks like. The design pass is M7; until then, no UI-detail assertions.
- **Never leave a dev server orphaned.** On Windows, killing the shell does not
  kill child node processes. Let `npm run e2e` finish or stop it explicitly.
  `reuseExistingServer` is off on purpose — do not turn it on, and do not add a
  script that kills whatever holds the port.
- **No life-as-code here.** This repo is a plain repo by decision.

## Secrets

`SESSION_SECRET` signs the identity cookie and hashes device tokens.
`wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET` in production, `.dev.vars` locally.
`sessionSecret()` throws rather than falling back to the dev value in
production.
